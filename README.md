# .NET Aspire
.NET Aspire is a set of powerful tools, templates, and packages for building observable, production ready apps.  
.NET Aspire is delivered through a collection of NuGet packages that handle specific cloud-native concerns.  
Cloud-native apps often consist of small, interconnected pieces or microservices rather than a single, monolithic code base.  
Cloud-native apps generally consume a large number of services, such as databases, messaging, and caching.  
For information on support, see the .NET Aspire Support Policy.
